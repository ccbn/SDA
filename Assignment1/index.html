		<h2>Part 2: DAOST Chapter 3 Questions</h2>
		<h3>Looking at Fig 3-1, Janert writes "the data itself shows clearly that the amount of random noise in the data is small". 
			What do you think his argument is?</h3>
		<p>
			He is confident that the amount of random noise is small because the data follows smooth curves. It clearly follows a pattern. If there was some data breaking the pattern, 
			then it would probabily be noise in the data. We do not see a single point outside the pattern, therefore low noise in data.
		</p>
		<h3>Can you think of a real-world example of a multivariate relationship like the one in Fig 3-3 (lower right panel)?</h3>
		<p>
			An example of a multivariate relationship could be the measure of the effectiveness of a treatment on an infection over time. The x-axis shows the time and the y-axis shows the infection number. 
			Each point would represent af measure of the infection number on a patient after a certain time when the treatment began. The treatment could therefore have different results depending on the patient groups. For instance, young people could be affected different than older people.
		</p>
		<h3>What are the two methods Janert metions for smoothing noisy data? Can you think of other ones?</h3>
		<p>
			The two methods mentioned are Spline and LOSS. There are other smoothing methods existing. We did not know any ourselfs, but we found out online that there are multiple ones:
		</p>
		<ul>
				<li>Additive smoothing</li>
				<li>Laplacian smoothing</li>
				<li>Butterworth filter</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Depending on what kind of data you have you will apply a specific method for smoothing it out. 
		</p>
		<h3>What are residuals? Why is it a good idea to plot the residuals of your fit?</h3>
		<p>The residuals are the measure of error of the model compared to the real data. Plotting residuals means you can 
		easily tell how correct your model is. If the residual plot shows your model is very far off from the true values, then you should consider to change your model to fit the data.  
		</p>
		<h3>Explain in your own words the point of the smooth tube in figure 3-7.</h3>
		<p>
			The smooth tube is useful for predicting values. For instance in figure 3-7, you can assume most of the results in year 1920 was between 142 and 150. You can also extent the smoothing curves to include the future to predict future values. 
			This is useful if you want to predict what the expected results of marathon runners are in the future. The danger of extenting the smoothing curves is that the model based on historic data is not neccesarily a good estimator for predicting the future. 
		</p>
		<h3>What kind of relationships will a semi-log plot help you discover?</h3>
		<p>
			The semi-log plot can help you discover the relationship between x and y is exponential. If you take the log of y as a function of x, the plot will show either the data following a straight line or not. If it follows a straight line, then we know the relationship of x and y is exponential otherwise not. 
		</p>
		<h3>What kind of functions will loglog plots help you see?</h3>
		<p>The loglog plots can help you discover power-law relationship of x and y. For instance, their example shows that the heart rate of an animal is related to the mass of the animal. Specifically it shows f ~ m<sup>-1/4</sup> where m is the mass and f is the heart rate.
		Notice it does not specifically tell the heart rate size but only the relationship between x and y.

		<h3>What the h#ll is banking and what element from our visual system does it use to help us see patterns? What are potential problems with banking?</h3>
		<p>
			Banking is a graphical method where you change the aspect ratio of the plot. Sometimes changing the aspect ratio The aspect ratio can
